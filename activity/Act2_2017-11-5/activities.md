# NIM Activity 2 : introduction to GAN

## 谢津：Introduction of GAN

1. Basical GAN : a min-max game.

2. Improvements of GAN

* DCGAN : new structure, ReLU activation and other tricks.
* WGAN : Remove `sigmoid` of Discriminator, reconstruct loss function and parameter clipping.
* Improved WGAN : substitude WGAN's parameter clipping with gradient penalty.

3. Various applications of GAN.

* cGAN.
* infoGAN.
* semi-supervise infoGAN.
* cycle-GAN. style transfer.

## 游凯超：Notes on DCGAN

* Detailed tricks of DCGAN.
* Detailed explaination of deconvolution (transposed convolution or fractional convolution).
* Introduction of subpixel.

## 徐鉴劲：NIM project start

* Call for participation in the project.
* Rough project plan is described in ice-breaking slides.
* Fine plan will be released later.
