# Some Regulations and Tips for Team Activity

## Overall Advices

1. If you are confused with setup of some projects, go to your leader's home (`atlantix`) and copy his configuration.

## Server Usage

1. Be careful with `sudo` operation, although many of you do not have the permission. The alternative is to use user option. For example, using `--user` in `pip` installation or `make install` to your home directory.
