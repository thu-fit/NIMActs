# NIM Activity 1 : Warm-ups

Choose serveral tasks from each of the groups and try to solve them!
In the meeting, we may discuss around these topics.

There is one thing important to remind you of: Keep a nice record in order to share it with the team.

## Play around with open source projects

- Anime character generation with discrete labels.
http://make.girls.moe/
- iGAN: interactive GAN. Available on Github.
- Neural Photo Editor: human face editor. Available on Github.
- illustration2vec: anime character classifier. Available on Github.

Share your results and thoughts about these projects. Reading the paper of these projects will be beneficial, but may require some basic understanding of GAN research.

## Learn the basics (VERY IMPORTANT)

* The paper: Unsupervised Representation Learning with Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks.
* DCGAN on github.
* Reading papers cited by above is strongly recommended. This will help you get into GAN field.

Reproduction of this paper is strongly recommended.

Share your understanding of the paper and the code of the project.

## Think wildly

We may brainstorm around Neural Image Manipulation. What do you think of manipulating images by semantic measures? What do you think can be the application of this technique? Can you come up with a realistic plan for a NIM?

Share your ideas!
